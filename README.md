<h2>What was done:</h2>


*   First of all I re-wrote the code using semantic tags and following the accessibility guidelines for the website to be more SEO friendly.
*   The company logo has yellow as an accent color and the letter "W" has a cut corner. The logo itself is written in italic. I decided to use these elements to brighten up the page. Thus the titles and subtitles are in italic with a touch of an accent color.
*   The button and a team image have the cut corners which correlates to the letter W from the logo.
*   Some animation as well as hover details and the video for images adds a bit of interactivity.
*   The main picture fits in with the colors of the page and shows the tee clearly stating that the website is connected to golf.
*   The golf websites are usually light themes. However I wanted it to have both dark and light modes so the toggle was implemented in the header.
*   There is also a mobile version.
